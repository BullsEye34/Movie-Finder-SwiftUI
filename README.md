## Running
In order for the application to work:
1. Open the project in XCode
2. `cd Movie-Finder-SwiftUI/Movie Finder/Resources`
3. Create a new File: `Secrets.swift`
4. Paste the below as the contents of your file:

import Foundation

let movieApiKey = "<YOUR_API_KEY>";
```
5. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual API Key from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api after creating account/logging in.
6. Run the project on your device/Simulator
7. Enjoy
